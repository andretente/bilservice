Exercise:
- Rebuild the website www.bilservice.me 
- Have a new "fresh" look
- That all advertising is removed
- That new "mood pictures" are chosen and are large and high resolution
- That a new log is created (as an image or as a text with a particular font)
- That the left menu first five choices are moved to a horizontal main menu
- That you appropriately shorten the text in the menu selection so that they fit into the new menu
- Remove other menu items
- That you select new fonts from Google Fonts for headers and breadth
- That all html is modern (html5) and semantic (rather use tags like header, main, footer, article and section than div-tags)
- That the "Approximate hourly rates for car service" section on the "Car Service Timing Prices" section is hidden from the beginning and expires when you click on a button "Show hourly rates"
- That the button then changes text to "Hide hourly rates" and this happens if you click it
- That the "Approximate hourly rates for car service" section of the "Car Service Timing Prices" section is redrawn so that they retrieve prices from a JSON file.
- That the page / menu item "Car Service Depending on Car Model" has three submenu choices and sub pages called "Volvo", "Audi" and "BMW". The text on these pages should as yet be nonsense text / placeholder text of the type "lorem ipsum".
- The submenu selection should be displayed vertically (as a dropdown) when you hover over the main menu item.
